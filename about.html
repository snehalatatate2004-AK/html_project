    <div class="info-text">
        <p>
            Shri Vitthal, also known as Vithoba or Panduranga, is considered a loving and approachable form of Lord Krishna. He is especially worshipped in Maharashtra and is the central deity of the Bhakti movement. Unlike royal or warrior forms of God, Vitthal is seen as a friend, guide, and protector of common people.
            Great saints like Sant Dnyaneshwar, Sant Tukaram, Sant Namdev, and Sant Eknath expressed their devotion through abhangas (devotional poems), which are still sung today. These teachings emphasized devotion over rituals and encouraged social harmony by rejecting caste discrimination. Shri Vitthal’s worship continues to inspire millions to follow the path of devotion, simplicity, and moral living.

        <p>
           Mata Rukmini, the divine consort of Shri Vitthal, symbolizes devotion, patience, and spiritual strength. Her presence represents balance and harmony in life, teaching that devotion must be accompanied by love, understanding, and commitment. The Rukmini temple, located close to the Vitthal Mandir, holds special importance in the pilgrimage.
           Devotees strongly believe that a visit to Pandharpur is incomplete without seeking blessings from Mata Rukmini. Her worship highlights the importance of family values, equality between partners, and unity in spiritual life. Together, Shri Vitthal and Mata Rukmini represent the ideal divine companionship.

        <p>
            The Wari tradition is the heart of Pandharpur’s devotional culture and one of the largest spiritual movements in India. Every year, during Ashadhi and Kartiki Ekadashi, thousands of devotees known as Warkaris walk for several days from places like Alandi and Dehu to Pandharpur.
            Carrying palkhis (palanquins) of saintly padukas, devotees chant abhangas and sing the name of Lord Vitthal with discipline and devotion. The Wari teaches values of unity, equality, self-discipline, and devotion, regardless of social or economic status. This living tradition continues to strengthen spiritual bonds and preserve Maharashtra’s cultural identity.
